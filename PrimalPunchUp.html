        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Primal Punch-Up was made by me and a group of 4 other students using an <b>agile development approach</b>.
            Over the course of 4 sprints, each lasting 2-3 weeks, different iterations of the game were produced,
            from a tech demo all the way to a polished final product. Each sprint, <b>play-tests</b> were held with other
            members of the class and after each student had played the game they could then fill out a google form to give feedback. This
            aided us in defining our <b>goals (written as user-stories)</b> for the next sprint. Each sprint also consisted of at least
            4 <b>SCRUM meetings</b>, where user stories mapped on our trello board would be updated to their appropriate section, and the team
            would discuss their recent contributions as well as any factors that could inhibit further development.

        <h2>Challenges in Development</h2>
        <p>Throughout the development process there were many challenges that required me and my team members to learn new skills:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item hidden">
            <p>
                <b>Blender 4.0:</b> Blender was used to create simple meshes and to rig bones to character meshes so that they could be animated using Mixamo.
                Unique character movements allowed for visual clarity and user visual feedback.
            </p>

        <div class="flex-item hidden">
            <p>
                <b>Controller Inputs:</b> For the local multiplayer feel we wanted to achieve, we needed to learn how to use Unity's controller input system,
                how to implement it's functions in code, and how to allow controllers to interact with UI.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flex-item hidden">
            <p>
                <b>Local Multiplayer:</b> We created a split screen effect by dynamically changing camera components based on player number, and also created
                multiple UI versions for differing numbers of players.
            </p>
            <img src="images/PPU%20UI.png">
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item hidden">
            <p>
                <b>PvP Combat:</b> Character abilities were reworked, balanced and fine-tuned based on player feedback, so that combat
                could feel satisfying to play, but also fair to play against.
            </p>

        <div class="flex-item hidden">
            <p>
                <b>Animation Events:</b> Functions had to be called from character scripts based on specific frames of an animation, so that
                hit-boxes and animations could be synced.

                    SXSW Sydney for saw the potential of our game, Primal Punch-Up and allowed us to present the project as a part of the student showcase in 2024.
                    <br><br>
                    As a result of this opportunity, I was able to attend a range of insightful game development seminars and show off Primal Punch-Up to the enthusiastic network of industry professionals, fellow student developers and gamers at SWSX.
                    <br><br>
                    It was great to see so many people enjoy and interact with a game we've put so much time and effort into.
