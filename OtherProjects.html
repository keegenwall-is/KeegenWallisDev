            <h2>Maya Plug-Ins</h2>
            <p>
                This Integrity-Checker plug-in was made for <b>Maya</b> using <b>Python</b>. It's purpose was to aid artists by running through a list of common
                issues that arise in creating animations in Maya, and testing to see if the current scene passes without any issues. Assets that caused tests to fail
                would be printed in a log below and the issue would be identified. These common issues can be seen
                in the related image.

            <h2>Work in XCode</h2>
            <p>
                While learning to develop in XCode with <b>Swift and SwiftUI</b>, I was able to create a few simple apps. Namely, a simple bubble pop game app, where
                the player could select a time and max number of bubbles. Gameplay would see bubbles moving across the screen and the highest number of bubbles
                would be saved to a leaderboard with the player's name. <br><br> The other notable app I was involved in creating was made in a team of 3, where
                we used an API to use trivia questions from different categories. High scores were then kept under player names with a combined score across
                all categories, or individual scores for each category.

            <h2>LoL App</h2>
            <p>
                This app was a project created within the DOTNET environment with the purpose of providing a service for players of the
                popular online game "League of Legends". This app allows users to track their champion masteries after registering an account,
                as well as to practice creating custom item build sets. <br><br> This LoL App was created in just a couple weeks but was my 
                first time <b>integrating an API</b> and transfering data from the API into our own database. The app was developed entirely within 
                the DOTNET environment with C# and using an <b>MVC framework</b>. Two different API's were used, the offical riot API and the fan made 
                CommunityDragon API.
