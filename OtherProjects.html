        <h2>Maya Plug-Ins</h2>
        <p>This Integrity-Checker plug-in was made for <b>Maya</b> using <b>Python</b>. It's purpose was to aid artists by running through a list of common
        issues that arise in creating animations in Maya, and testing to see if the current scene passes without any issues. Assets that caused tests to fail
            would be printed in a log below and the issue would be indicated to. These common issues can be seen
            in the image to the right.

        <h2>Work in XCode</h2>
        <p>While learning to develop in XCode with <b>Swift and SwiftUI</b>, I was able to create a few simple apps; namely a simple bubble pop game app, where
        the player could select a time and max number of bubbles. Gameplay would see bubbles moving across thee screen and the highest number of bubbles
        would be saved to a leaderboard with the players name. <br><br> The other notable app I was involved in creating was made in a team of 3, where
        we used an API to take trivia questions of different categories. High scores were then kept under player names with a combined score across
        all categories, or individual scores for each category.</p>
